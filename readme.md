# Persona AI

## üîç Overview
**Persona AI** is a lightweight web application that instantly customizes the user feed by predicting a user's persona‚Äîwithout any need for sign-in. By asking a few simple questions such as age, education, and experience, it creates a personalized feed tailored to the user's profile.

## üåü Features
- No login or sign-up required  
- Smart persona prediction (e.g., Beginner, Worker, etc.)  
- Dynamically generated and personalized content feed  
- Lightweight and fast front-end experience

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack
- HTML  
- CSS  
- JavaScript  
- Flask (Python)

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Faizulmd13/persona-ai.git
   cd persona-ai
   ```

2. Run the app (you may need to set up a virtual environment and install Flask):
   ```bash
   pip install flask
   python app.py
   ```

3. Open `localhost:5000` in your browser to use the application.

## üí° How It Works
Once the project is running, users are prompted to enter basic information like age, education, experience, and occupation. Clicking the "Predict Persona" button uses AI to identify the user's persona and serve a customized page based on that persona.

## ‚úÖ Project Status
- ‚úîÔ∏è Project is complete
- üîú Future improvements include expanding persona types and generalizing its use across multiple domains and web applications.

# üìÑ Abstract & Final Report

## Abstract
The Persona AI project aims to transform digital marketing and educational user experiences by leveraging artificial intelligence, behavioral data, multilingual NLP, and explainable personalization techniques. In Phase 5, the system is fully prepared for demonstration, documentation, and handover. This phase presents the AI system's dynamic persona detection, real-time recommendation engine, voice and multilingual capabilities, and its ability to handle high user load securely. This document includes all essential technical documentation, feedback integration, system architecture, codebase highlights, and plans for future scalability. Screenshots of the working prototype, code samples, and ERP integration diagrams are included.

## 1. Project Demonstration

### Overview
The Persona AI system will be presented to academic and technical stakeholders in a real-time demo environment, showcasing its ability to detect personas, adapt content, handle multilingual queries, and maintain data privacy.

### Demonstration Details
- **System Walkthrough**: From user onboarding to content display, demonstrating how the platform customizes homepages based on persona (Beginner, Professional, Freelancer, etc.).
- **Persona Switching**: Real-time change in user persona and how it reshapes the interface and content blocks dynamically.
- **Multilingual UI and Voice Demo**: Interface toggling between English and regional languages (e.g., Tamil, Hindi), with real-time voice-to-text interaction support.
- **Explainable AI Engine**: Content blocks display ‚ÄúWhy recommended?‚Äù tags based on behavioral history and AI decisions.
- **Performance Metrics**: Demonstrate system load testing results, speed under multiple concurrent users, and PWA responsiveness.
- **Security & Privacy**: Showcase cookie management, local persona storage, encryption policies, and how users control their own data.

### Outcome
Stakeholders will observe how the AI system operates in real time, validating the success of multilingual expansion, persona blending logic, and privacy-first architecture.
